### luaio - kernel Lua I/O API

I'm working on NetBSD kernel I/O bindings for kernel Lua under [lneto](https://github.com/lneto)'s mentorship.
That work continues [salazar](https://github.com/salazar) work [luaio](https://github.com/salazar/luaio).

### Current step
Currently, I'm fixing known issues (and searching/creating new :D) and improving salazar's patches.
One of the main problems with current luaio implementation is performance.
